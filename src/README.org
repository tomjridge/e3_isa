* E3 isabelle verification

  - based on OCaml code at https://github.com/tomjridge/e3

  - for dependencies between .thy files, see e3.dot (e3.svg) file
    - note that E3_prelude.thy is a dependency of all files

  - description of .thy files
    - E3_prelude.thy - common defns
    - E3_abstract_types - axiomatically declared basic types (nt, tm etc, no sets or maps)
    - E3_concrete_types - basic types with standard defns
    - E3 
      - record of operations over basic types, and declarations of record types for sets
      - definitions of core code, including "earley" function
      - all definitions essentially "parametric" (so why depend on E3_concrete_types?)
    - E3_impl - specialization of E3 code to E3_concrete_types
    - E3_spec - specification of Earley's algorithm at a high level
