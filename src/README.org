* E3 isabelle verification

  - based on OCaml code at https://github.com/tomjridge/e3

  - for dependencies between .thy files, see e3.dot (e3.svg) file
    - note that E3_prelude.thy is a dependency of all files

  - description of .thy files
    - E3_prelude.thy - common defns
    - E3_core_types.thy - axiomatically declared basic types, and
      parametric sets and maps, with standard implementations of these
      parametric types
    - E3 
      - the code for the earley parser, upto defn of loop2, using parametric types
    - E3_spec - specification of Earley's algorithm at a high level
    - E3_sound - initial statement of invariant (incomplete, needs extending)
